<h2>What is Ecom?</h2>
<p>"Ecommerce" or "electronic commerce" is the trading of goods and services on the internet.
 It is your bustling city center or brick-and-mortar shop translated into zeroes and ones on the internet superhighway.
  An estimated 2.14 billion people worldwide buy goods and services online.
Ecommerce is one way people buy and sell things in retail. Some companies sell products online only, 
while other sellers use ecommerce as a part of a broader strategy that includes physical stores and other 
distribution channels. Either way, ecommerce allows startups, small businesses, and large companies to sell
 products at scale and reach customers across the world</p>
